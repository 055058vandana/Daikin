# Industrial Visit to Daikin Industries – ERD Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project documents the development of an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for **Daikin Industries** based on an industrial visit. The ERD aims to **capture essential business processes** and visualize **data flow** across various operational functions, including:  
✅ Order Processing  
✅ Inventory Management  
✅ Customer Engagement  
✅ Supplier Coordination  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 📍 **Design a comprehensive ERD** that maps key data relationships across Daikin's business operations.  
- 📍 **Identify critical data connections** to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making.  
- 📍 **Provide a structured visualization** of data flow to support system optimization and business insights.  

## 🏗 ERD Components  
The ERD consists of the following primary entities:  

🔹 **Employee** – Stores employee details (ID, name, designation) for structured role management.  
🔹 **Customer** – Maintains customer information (ID, name, contact) for seamless order processing and support.  
🔹 **Order** – Represents customer transactions and is linked to order details and processing schedules.  
🔹 **Order Details** – Captures product-specific information for each order, ensuring clarity and traceability.  
🔹 **Product** – Contains details about available items, categorized for efficient inventory tracking.  
🔹 **Supplier** – Stores supplier profiles to ensure smooth procurement and inventory restocking.  
🔹 **Inventory** – Monitors stock levels and availability, improving warehouse and order fulfillment efficiency.  
🔹 **Service Request** – Connects customers to after-sales support and maintenance for enhanced service quality.  

The relationships in the ERD include **one-to-many (1:M)** and **many-to-many (M:N)** associations, accurately reflecting Daikin’s data management and operational workflow.
